<h4 align=center>❝ L'art pour l'art ❞</h4>

I write code to explore ideas. not to optimize resumes. <br>
Most things here exist because I found them interesting.

This profile is mostly experiments, half-finished ideas, <br>
and things I wanted to understand better.

If something here looks odd, unfinished, or unnecessary - that’s probably the point.
